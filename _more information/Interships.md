### üìú Historical and Mathematical Background

The study of **Separated Nets** originates from a classic question in geometric group theory and metric geometry, formulated by Mikhail Gromov in the 1990s. It connects deeply to the study of large-scale geometry, quasi-isometries, and the coarse classification of metric spaces.  
Gromov asked a fundamental question:

> ‚ÄúAre any two separated nets in the same Euclidean space necessarily bi-Lipschitz equivalent?‚Äù

This problem sits at the crossroads of geometry, topology, and functional analysis, and has significant implications ‚Äî from understanding large-scale geometric structures to applications in tilings, quasicrystals, and discrete models of continuous spaces.  
While the statement has been shown to hold in **infinite-dimensional Banach spaces**, its validity in finite-dimensional spaces remains an open and highly nontrivial problem.

### üßÆ Definition ‚Äî Separated Net

A **separated net** $ N \subset \mathbb{R}^d $ is a discrete subset of Euclidean space satisfying two key properties:

1. **Uniform Discreteness:** There exists $ r > 0 $ such that the distance between any two distinct points in $ N $ is at least $ r $.  
2. **Relative Density:** There exists $ R > 0 $ such that every point in $ \mathbb{R}^d $ lies within distance $ R $ of some point of $ N $.

Intuitively, separated nets can be viewed as ‚Äúwell-distributed discrete samples‚Äù of the continuous space ‚Äî not too close to each other, but also not too sparse.

### üî¨ My Contributions

During this internship, my work focused on exploring this open question from a constructive and computational perspective. My main tasks and achievements include:

- Conducted a comprehensive literature review on the history and development of the separated nets problem and its connections to geometric group theory.  
- Implemented algorithms to construct explicit examples of separated nets in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces and investigate their geometric properties.  
- Designed computational tools to test bi-Lipschitz equivalence between different nets and identified structural features affecting equivalence.  
- Analyzed counterexamples and limiting behaviors, providing new insights into why Gromov‚Äôs conjecture remains unresolved in finite dimensions.

This project allowed me to connect deep theoretical questions in metric geometry with concrete computational experiments, offering a broader perspective on how discrete structures capture the geometry of continuous spaces.
