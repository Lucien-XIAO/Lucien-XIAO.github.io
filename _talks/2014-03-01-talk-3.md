  <strong>Talk:</strong> “ The evolution of the Numbers.”  
Presented during my L3 English course at Sorbonne Université, this presentation discusses how humans create numbers to quantify phenomena in everyday life, and how the development of mathematics and physics has, in turn, shaped the evolution of numbers.
