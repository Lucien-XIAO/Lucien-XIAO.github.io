## Course details

Here is a detailed introduction to the Markov I course.

* **Professeur:** [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
* **Class format:** Lecture course without TDs
* **ECTS:** 6+3 ECTS (For major applied probability and EDProba, it's only 6 ECTS - don't need to study Poisson cloud)
* **Content:**
    * Markov chain (including random graphs)
    * Markov process (continuous time + discrete state)
    * Poisson cloud
* **Difficulty coefficient:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
* **Characteristics:**
    * The pace is fast and there’s a lot of content, but it’s not very difficult.
    * The teacher especially likes to use original questions from past finals on the final exam.
    * You may bring notes and any handwritten or printed material (including your own answers from previous exams) to the final exam
