## 1. Organization of Optional Courses

* **Optional courses start in the last week of January**.
* Each course lasts **24 hours**, in one of the following formats:
    * 8 weeks × 3h per week, or
    * 12 weeks × 2h per week.
* The **first week of March** is, in principle, a **teaching break week**.

---

## 2. Validation of Semester 2

In the second semester, the student must validate **30 ECTS**, distributed as follows:

1. **3 optional courses of 6 ECTS each** (18 ECTS total).
2. **One thesis or one internship worth 12 ECTS**.

The course catalog offers **20 optional courses**, grouped into **7 thematic blocks**.

* The student must validate **at least 3 optional courses**.
* Course selection is **completely free**, regardless of thematic blocks.
* However, it is **strongly recommended to validate more than 3 courses** (see the bonus system below).

---

## 3. Consideration of Course Grades

Grades obtained in optional courses are ranked in decreasing order:

$$N_1 \ge N_2 \ge N_3 \ge N_4 \ge N_5 \ge \dots$$

### Contract Courses (Mandatory)
* Grades **$N_1, N_2, N_3$** are recorded as the **three mandatory courses** of the semester.
* If two or three of these grades belong to the same thematic block, this has **no impact for the student**: the jury will administratively assign them to three distinct blocks.

### Non-Contract Courses (Bonus)
* Grades **$N_4, N_5, N_6, \dots$** correspond to **non-contract courses**.
* These courses are not mandatory but can provide **significant bonus points**.

#### Definition of Thresholds
* ✅ **Validated course**: Grade $\ge 10/20$
* ⚠️ **Almost validated course**: $8/20 \le \text{Grade} < 10/20$
* ❌ **Non-validated course**: Grade $< 8/20$

---

## 4. Bonus System

The system encourages taking additional courses:

* **First validated non-contract course** (if $N_4 \ge 10$):
    * **+1 point** added to $N_2$ and $N_3$.
    * Gain on the semester average: **+0.4 point** (/20).

* **Each additional validated non-contract course** ($N_5, N_6, \dots$):
    * **+1 point** added to $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$.
    * Gain on the average: **+0.6 point** (/20).

* **Each almost validated course** ($8 \le N < 10$):
    * **+1 point** added to $N_3$.
    * Gain on the average: **+0.2 point** (/20).

---

## 5. Degree Classification (Honors)

On a CV, only the **degree classification** appears, and it is often decisive.

* **Pass with Merit (Assez Bien)**: Annual average $\ge 12/20$
* **Good (Bien)**: Annual average $\ge 14/20$
* **Very Good (Très Bien)**: Annual average $\ge 16/20$

> 👉 **Strategy**: An additional optional course can make it possible to **change the degree classification**.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: The jury is sovereign and is **systematically unfavorable** in awarding honors if:
> * Semester 2 is validated **by compensation**.
> * One or more mandatory course grades are low (in particular if **$N_3 < 10$**).

---

## 6. Exceptional Case: 2 Courses + 18-ECTS Internship

The option to validate **2 optional courses + an 18-ECTS internship** is **exceptional**. It is reserved for:
* Long industrial internships,
* With strict attendance requirements,
* When it is impossible to include absence clauses to attend courses.

---

## 7. Track-Specific Recommendations

### EDP–Probability Major
* Students are **strongly encouraged** to choose courses from the **Probability–Analysis block**.
* The M2 *Modeling* program (resp. A. Gloria) also offers **3 elective courses**.
* *Note: These are recommendations for program coherence, not mandatory requirements.*

### Courses Outside the Official Catalog
* It is possible to validate courses from other master’s programs/universities (with certification).
* **Important**: These courses **do not count toward the average** and **do not provide bonuses** (except, exceptionally, for certain courses from the M2 Modeling program).

---

# Academic Monitoring, Thesis, and Internship

## 1. Course Selection and Monitoring

* **Trial period**: During the **first 2 to 3 weeks**, students are advised to attend as many courses as possible to make an informed choice.
* **Registration**: **End of February**, each instructor finalizes the list of officially registered students.
* **Auditing**: It is possible to attend courses without taking the exam.
* **Exams**: Registration with the instructor is **mandatory** to take the exam.
* **Communication**: Instructors communicate directly with their groups (by email). **No information is posted on the website.**

---

## 2. M2 Thesis

The thesis consists of studying one or more scientific articles, written in **LaTeX** and defended before a jury.

### Supervision and Validation
1. **Finding a topic**: Contact an instructor (from the proposed list or on personal initiative).
2. **Academic Validation**:
    * **LPSM / M2 PMA supervisor**: No validation required.
    * **External supervisor**: **Mandatory validation before starting**. Send by email: name/function of the supervisor, articles to be studied, and a project summary.

### Thesis Evaluation Grid
The supervisor proposes a grade according to the following scale:

* **10–13 / 20**: Very borderline work, but validated.
* **14 / 20**: Sufficient bibliographic study.
* **15 / 20**: Complete and detailed bibliographic study.
* **16 / 20**: Very complete and particularly well-prepared bibliographic work.
* **17 / 20**: Same + beginning of autonomous research (not publishable).
* **18 / 20**: Same + publishable work (second-tier journal).
* **19 / 20**: Same + publishable work (top-tier journal).
* **20 / 20**: Very high-level work (*Annals of Probability*, *PTRF*).

### Timeline
* **February – April**: Topic search.
* **April – June/September**: Writing.
* **June 25**: Deadline for graduation in July (1st session).
* **September 30**: Deadline for graduation in October (2nd session).
* *Note: The majority of defenses take place in September.*

## 3. M2 Internship

### Conditions and Internship Agreement
* **Prerequisite**: Validation of Semester 1 is mandatory (compensation accepted).
* **Academic validation**: Submit the internship description **before** signing the agreement.
* **Supervision**: Mandatory dual supervision (company internship supervisor + **Sorbonne University faculty member**).
* **Agreement**: Via the SU internship platform (signature handled by Yann Poncin).

### Duration and Deadlines
* Start generally in **April**.
* Can last until **December 2026** (for long internships).
* **Warning**: An extension beyond **December 15, 2026** implies **repeating the M2 year**.
