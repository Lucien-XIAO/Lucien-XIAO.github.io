## 1. Validation of the 1st Semester

In the first semester, the average is calculated based on **four grades** out of 20:
- two **9 ECTS** courses (grades x and y),
- two **6 ECTS** courses (grades z and w).

The semester average is given by:
\[
M = \frac{9x + 9y + 6z + 6w}{30}
\]

### Possible Cases

#### Case 1 – Direct Admission
- All grades **x, y, z, w ≥ 10/20**  
→ The semester is **validated in the first session**.  
No grade may be retaken.

#### Case 2 – Compensated Semester
- **M ≥ 10/20**, but some grades are **< 10/20**

Two options are available:
- **Accept the compensation**:  
  - the semester is validated in the first session;
  - grades become final and cannot be modified.
- **Refuse the compensation**:  
  - the student is failed in the first session;
  - grades **≥ 10/20** are acquired and cannot be retaken;
  - grades **< 10/20** must be retaken in the **second session**, and only the second-session grades are taken into account.

#### Case 3 – Failure
- **M < 10/20**

→ The student is failed in the first session:
- grades **≥ 10/20** are acquired;
- grades **< 10/20** must be retaken in the **second session**;
- only the grades from the second session are taken into account.

📅 **The second session of the 1st semester takes place in March.**

## 2. Important Points Regarding Validation of the M2

- In **M2**, there is **no annual compensation**:  
  **each semester must be validated separately**.
- If the **1st semester is not validated**, it is **impossible to graduate in the same academic year**, regardless of the result of the second semester.
- It is **strictly impossible**:
  - to validate the **thesis (master’s dissertation) course** before validating the 1st semester;
  - to **sign an internship agreement** without validation of the 1st semester.  
  👉 **No exemption will be granted.**

The second session in March is organized to allow students who validate the 1st semester to **sign an internship agreement** and **start their internship on April 1st**.

## 3. Repeating a Year

- **Repeating a year is not a right**.
- The jury is **systematically unfavorable** to repeating a year for students who have validated **less than 15 ECTS** in the first semester.

👉 It is therefore strongly recommended to avoid this type of situation.
