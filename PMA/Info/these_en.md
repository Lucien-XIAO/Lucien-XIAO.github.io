**Mathematics – Doctoral School ED 386 (Paris Centre)**

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Required degree**: hold a **Master 2 (M2)** degree no later than **2026**.
- **Three essential elements to start a PhD**:
  1. a **supervisor**;
  2. a **PhD topic**;
  3. **funding (PhD scholarship)**.

---

## 2. Anticipate during the M2 thesis or internship
If you are considering a PhD, it is essential to **start gathering information as early as the choice of your M2 thesis or internship**, by discussing directly with your supervisor:
- can the thesis/internship topic lead to a **PhD project**?
- does the supervisor have (or plan to have) **research project funding** (ANR, ERC, etc.) that includes a PhD position?
- are there **specific thematic scholarships** to apply for, and under what conditions?

👉 Applying for a PhD requires a **proactive approach to research**.

---

## 3. Application via the Doctoral School (last-resort option)
If no project-based funding is available, it is possible to submit an application to the **Doctoral School** to which the supervisor belongs.

### Doctoral School ED 386 – Paris Centre
- **Universities**: Sorbonne University, Université Paris Diderot, Université Paris Descartes (former Paris 5, 6, 7)
- **Laboratories**: LJLL, LPSM, MAP5, IMJ, etc.
- **Head of the Doctoral School**: Idris Kharroubi  
- **Administrative office**: Jean-François Venutti  
- **Website**: http://ed386.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html

---

## 4. Timeline
- **May**: opening of the call for applications  
- **Mid-June**: application deadline  
- **June**: internal ranking by laboratories (e.g. LPSM)  
- **Early July**: Doctoral School committee and final ranking

---

## 5. Number of scholarships
- ED 386 awards **between 22 and 26 PhD scholarships** each year across all laboratories:
  - approximately half for Paris 6;
  - the other half for Paris 7;
  - usually **one scholarship for Paris 5**.

---

## 6. Application file
The application file must be **complete** and include:
- a **supervisor who is a member of ED 386** and commits to supervising the PhD  
  - **co-supervision** is possible, provided that at least one of the two supervisors is a member of the Doctoral School;
- a **coherent PhD project**;
- **academic transcripts**;
- if the M2 thesis is not yet completed: a **statement from the supervisor** indicating that the thesis is close to completion.

It is **very important** to send a copy of the application file to the **M2 program coordinator**, so that they can support the application during selection meetings.

---

## 7. Internal ranking criteria (e.g. LPSM)
1. **Academic excellence** and affiliation with the laboratory’s Master programs  
   - Students from LPSM Master’s programs with excellent results are prioritized.
2. At an equivalent academic level:
   - thematic considerations;
   - number of PhD students already supervised by the prospective advisor;
   - other specific criteria.
3. **Alternative funding applications**:
   - candidates who did not apply for other available scholarships (e.g. ENS scholarships) are disadvantaged;
   - more generally, students from **Grandes Écoles** have a moral obligation to apply first to the funding schemes of their own institutions.

---

## 8. Final ranking by the Doctoral School
- Candidates in the **top core of the ranking** immediately receive a scholarship.
- Others are placed on a **waiting list**, which may evolve depending on withdrawals.

---

## 9. Special case – Year 2025
In **2025**, all students in the cohort obtained funding **outside the Doctoral School scholarships**.  
No applications were submitted to the ED, which allowed a scholarship to be awarded to a student who graduated in **2024**.
