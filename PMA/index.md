Here is the detailed official introduction of the M2-PMA 2025-2026 (French version) [[brochure 2025-2026]](\PMA\brochure2025.pdf) and the official website of M2-PMA [[web](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index)].

**A brief introduction to PMA**

M2-PMA is basically one of the strongest M2 programs in France for pure probability (the other being Université Paris-Saclay’s [M2 Mathématiques de l’aléatoire](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/mathematiques-et-applications/m2-mathematiques-de-laleatoire#programme)); of course we also can’t ignore the rising new force of Université Paris Dauphine-PSL’s M2 [MATH](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/mathematics-and-applied-mathematics/applied-and-theoretical-mathematics-masters-year-2).

M2-PMA admits about 20–30 people each year, including some ENS-PSL normaliens or normaliennes, engineers from X, and some very strong international students, for example from the University of Science and Technology of China ([the Sino-French program](https://cfmath.org/#about)). Most of them choose the Major in Stochastic Processes — roughly 20 people.

In the 2025–2026 academic year, M2-PMA added a major called "EDProba," which means "PDE + Probability." This major is jointly offered with M2 Modélisation. The first semester has 15 ECTS in Modélisation and 15 ECTS in PMA. The course options for the following semester are also fairly fixed, and there isn’t as much freedom for PMA students in that semester (look at Brochure 2025-2026). If you are enrolled as a Modélisation student, you will ultimately receive the Modélisation diploma, rather than the PMA diploma.

**Application recommendations or conditions**

I was admitted to M2-PMA from Sorbonne University M1 via eCandidat (Sorbonne University's application procedure). My M1 courses were: first semester: 1. Advanced Probability 2. Statistics; second semester: 1. Advanced Functional Analysis 2. Stochastic Calculus and Stochastic Control 3. M1 thesis

In my personal opinion and based on the information I have, for students who have already registered for M1 Mathematics and Applications at SU, admission to M2-PMA places the greatest importance on advanced probability (with [Thierry Lévy](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/levyt/probas_approfondies)) grades; anything above 14/20 is very competitive. This course is mainly the prerequisite material for the M2-PMA program, including conditional expectation, martingales, convergence of martingales, and Markov chains. (the specific content is almost identical to [Jean-François Le Gall](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~jean-francois.le-gall/)’s book "[Measure Theory, Probability, and Stochastic Processes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-14205-5)").
