## Course details

Here is a detailed introduction to the CS course.

* **Professeur:** [Nicolas Fournier](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~nfournier/)
* **Course office web:** https://perso.lpsm.paris/~nfournier/
* **Class format:** Lecture course with TDs
* **ECTS:** 9 ECTS 
* **Content:**
    * Brownian Motion
    * Filtrations and Martingales
    * Continuous semimartingalles
    * Stochastic Integration
    * Stochastic Differential Equations
* **Difficulty coefficient:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
* **Characteristics:**
    * This course is taught according to Jean-François Le Gall's book "[Brownian Motion, Martingales, and Stochastic Calculus](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-31089-3)".
    * Requires a solid ability in martingale convergence and martingale.
    * The exams are very difficult, but the teacher's style of setting questions is very consistent each time (reflected in the methods for solving them)
