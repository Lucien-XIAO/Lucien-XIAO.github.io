Here is the detailed official introduction of the M2-PMA 2025-2026 (French version) [[brochure 2025-2026]](PMA\brochure2025.pdf)

I was admitted to M2-PMA from Sorbonne University M1 via eCandidat (Sorbonne University's application procedure). My M1 courses were: first semester: 1. Advanced Probability 2. Statistics; second semester: 1. Advanced Functional Analysis 2. Stochastic Calculus and Stochastic Control 3. M1 thesis

In my personal opinion and based on the information I have, for students who have already registered for M1 Mathematics and Applications at SU, admission to M2-PMA places the greatest importance on advanced probability (with [Thierry Lévy](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/levyt/probas_approfondies)) grades; anything above 14/20 is very competitive. This course is mainly the prerequisite material for the M2-PMA program, including conditional expectation, martingales, convergence of martingales, and Markov chains. (the specific content is almost identical to [Jean-François Le Gall](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~jean-francois.le-gall/)’s book "[Measure Theory, Probability, and Stochastic Processes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-14205-5)").

Here is my M2-PMA course selection (Major stochastic process)

**Semester 1**

- Stochastic Calculus and Diffusion Processes
- Markov I (Discrete Markovian Models + Markov Processes and Applications )
- Convergence of Measures, Large Deviations, Percolation 
- Markov II (Poissonian Clouds, Levy Processes, and Excursions)
  
**Semester 2**
- Integrable probability & The KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) Universality Class
- Determinantal processes, random matrices and hyperuniformity
- Rough Paths and Stochastic differential equation
- Internship (Master thesis) at Laboratory
