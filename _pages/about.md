I am a second year Master's student in Probability and Random Models (M2 PMA) at Sorbonne University, co-qualified with École Normale Supérieure, Paris (ENS-PSL). Previously, I completed a double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at Sorbonne University.

My academic interests lie broadly in stochastic processes, probability theory, optimal transport, mathematical modeling, and their applications to complex systems and statistical physics. I enjoy exploring the mathematical foundations behind random phenomena and am particularly interested in problems involving process convergence, large deviations, and geometric properties of random structures.

I have been fortunate to work on several research projects, including the study of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of separated nets in Banach spaces, collective motion modeling, and numerical simulations of satellite trajectories. I am passionate about combining rigorous theoretical approaches with computational methods.
