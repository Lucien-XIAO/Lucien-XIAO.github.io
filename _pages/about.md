I am a second year Master's student in Probability and Random Models ([M2-PMA](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index)) with major stochastic process of [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at Sorbonne University ([SU](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)), co-qualified with Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure, Paris ([ENS-PSL](https://www.ens.psl.eu/)). 

Here is my M2-PMA course selection

**Semester 1**

- Stochastic Calculus and Diffusion Processes (9 ECTS) by [Nicolas Fournier](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~nfournier/)
- Discrete Markovian Models (6 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
- Markov Processes and Applications (3 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
- Convergence of Measures, Large Deviations, Percolation (6 ECTS) by [Thierry LÃ©vy](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/levyt/index)
- Poissonian Clouds, Levy Processes, and Excursions (6 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)  

**Semester 2**
- electives to be chosen


Previously, I completed a double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at  [SU](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

My academic interests lie broadly in optimal transport, optimization, probabilty theory, stochastic analysis and their applications in statistical physics.

I have been fortunate to work on several research projects, including the study of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of separated nets in Banach spaces with [Alexandros ESKENAZIS](https://www.alexandroseskenazis.com/) ([report](../interships/StageM1/rapport_M1.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageM1/diapo_M1.pdf)) on M1 and collective motion modeling with [Diane PEURICHARD](https://sites.google.com/site/dianepeurichard/home) ([report](../interships/StageL3/rappot.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageL3/diapo.pdf)) on L3.

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).

  Visualization results from my L3 internship on <em>collective motion in the presence of predators</em>. 
  The left animation shows the dynamics of a flock of 50 green agents when a single red predator is introduced, 
  while the right one shows the same system with three predators. I mainly focused on the modeling and analysis of such predatorâ€“prey interactions with python Code in my report.
