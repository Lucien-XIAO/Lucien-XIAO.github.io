I am a second year Master's student in Probability and Random Models ([M2-PMA](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index)) with major stochastic process of [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at Sorbonne Université ([SU](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)), co-qualified with École Normale Supérieure, Paris ([ENS-PSL](https://www.ens.psl.eu/)).

(Not a normalien student and Not ENS-PSL M2 Student.)

Here is my M2-PMA course selection

**Semester 1**

- Stochastic Calculus and Diffusion Processes (9 ECTS) by [Nicolas Fournier](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~nfournier/)
- Discrete Markovian Models (6 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
- Markov Processes and Applications (3 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
- Convergence of Measures, Large Deviations, Percolation (6 ECTS) by [Thierry Lévy](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/levyt/index)
- Poissonian Clouds, Levy Processes, and Excursions (6 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)  

**Semester 2**
- Integrable probability & The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Universality Class by [Guillaume Barraquand](https://www.phys.ens.psl.eu/~barraquand/)
- Determinantal processes, random matrices and hyperuniformity by [Raphaël Lachièze-Rey](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~rlachiez/)
- Rough Paths and Stochastic differential equation by [Lorenzo Zambotti](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/zambotti/index)
- Internship (Master thesis) at Laboratory


Previously, I completed a double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at  [SU](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

My academic interests lie broadly in random walk, probabilty theory, stochastic analysis and their applications in statistical physics. 

I have been fortunate to work on several research projects, including the study of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of separated nets in Banach spaces with [Alexandros ESKENAZIS](https://www.alexandroseskenazis.com/) ([report](../interships/StageM1/rapport_M1.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageM1/diapo_M1.pdf)) on M1 and collective motion modeling with [Diane PEURICHARD](https://sites.google.com/site/dianepeurichard/home) ([report](../interships/StageL3/rappot.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageL3/diapo.pdf)) on L3.

   <strong>1 : </strong>Visualization results from my L3 internship on <em>collective motion in the presence of predators</em>. 
  The left animation shows the dynamics of a flock of 50 green agents when a single red predator is introduced, 
  while the right one shows the same system with three predators. I mainly focused on the modeling and analysis of such predator–prey interactions with python Code in my report.

  <strong>2 : </strong>Result from my L3 physics internship on celestial mechanics.  
  We studied the classical <em>N-body model</em> in astrophysics and plotted the trajectories of the Moon and an Earth-orbiting satellite relative to the Earth.  
  The black dot represents the Earth, the blue curve corresponds to the actual satellite trajectory, and the red curve represents the actual Moon trajectory (real data obtained from NASA).  
  Using the 3-body model, we simulated the green trajectory for the satellite and the yellow trajectory for the Moon.
