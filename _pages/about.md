I am a second year Master's student in [Probability and Random Models (M2 PMA)](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index) of [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), co-qualified with [ENS-PSL](https://www.ens.psl.eu/). Previously, I completed a double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at  [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

My academic interests lie broadly in optimal transport, optimization, probabilty theory, stochastic analysis and their applications in machine learning.

I have been fortunate to work on several research projects, including the study of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of separated nets in Banach spaces with [Alexandros ESKENAZIS](https://www.alexandroseskenazis.com/)([report](../interships/rapport_M1.pdf), [slides](../interships/diapo_M1.pdf)) on M1 and collective motion modeling with [Diane PEURICHARD](https://sites.google.com/site/dianepeurichard/home) on L3.

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
