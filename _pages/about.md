I am a second year Master's student in [Probability and Random Models (M2 PMA)](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index) with major stochastic process of [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), co-qualified with [ENS-PSL](https://www.ens.psl.eu/). 

Here is my course selection:
**Semester 1**
- Stochastic Calculus and Diffusion Processes (9 ECTS) by [Nicolas Fournier](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~nfournier/)
- Discrete Markovian Models (6 ECTS) by [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
- Markov Processes and Applications (3 ECTS) [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
- Convergence of Measures, Large Deviations, Percolation (6 ECTS) [Thierry LÃ©vy](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/levyt/index)
- Poissonian Clouds, Levy Processes, and Excursions (6 ECTS) [Thomas Duquesne](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~tduquesne/)
**Semester 2**

Previously, I completed a double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at  [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

My academic interests lie broadly in optimal transport, optimization, probabilty theory, stochastic analysis and their applications in statistical physics.

I have been fortunate to work on several research projects, including the study of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of separated nets in Banach spaces with [Alexandros ESKENAZIS](https://www.alexandroseskenazis.com/) ([report](../interships/StageM1/rapport_M1.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageM1/diapo_M1.pdf)) on M1 and collective motion modeling with [Diane PEURICHARD](https://sites.google.com/site/dianepeurichard/home) ([report](../interships/StageL3/rappot.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageL3/diapo.pdf)) on L3.

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
