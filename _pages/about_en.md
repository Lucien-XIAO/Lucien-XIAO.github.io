**[Passer à la version française🇫🇷 / Switch to French version🇫🇷 ](/fr/)**

I am a second year Master's student in Probability and Random Models ([M2-PMA](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index)) with major stochastic process of [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at Sorbonne Université ([SU](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)), co-qualified with École Normale Supérieure, Paris ([ENS-PSL](https://www.ens.psl.eu/)).

(Not a normalien student and Not ENS-PSL M2 student.)

Previously, I completed a double Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics at  [SU](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

My academic interests lie broadly in random walk, probabilty theory, stochastic analysis and their applications in statistical physics. 

I have been fortunate to work on several research projects, including the study of bi-Lipschitz equivalence of separated nets in Banach spaces with [Alexandros ESKENAZIS](https://www.alexandroseskenazis.com/) ([report](../interships/StageM1/rapport_M1.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageM1/diapo_M1.pdf)) on M1 and collective motion modeling with [Diane PEURICHARD](https://sites.google.com/site/dianepeurichard/home) ([report](../interships/StageL3/rappot.pdf), [slides](../interships/StageL3/diapo.pdf)) on L3.
